</p>
<h1>Hello World! - A First Look</h1>
<p>
We will begin our exploration of JActor2 with a program that prints "Hello World!".
In the process, we will encounter a number of classes which play a major role when using JActor.
</p>
<pre>
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.blades.misc.Printer;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.facilities.Facility;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.messages.SyncRequest;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.reactors.IsolationReactor;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(final String[] _args) throws Exception {
        Facility facility = new Facility();
        try {
            IsolationReactor isolationReactor = new IsolationReactor(facility);
            Printer printer = new Printer(isolationReactor);
            SyncRequest<Void> printRequest = printer.printlnSReq("Hello World!");
            printRequest.call();
        } finally {
            facility.close();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/facilities/Facility.html">Facility</a>
</h3>
<pre>
        Facility facility = new Facility();
        try {
            ...
        } finally {
            facility.close();
        }
</pre>
<p>
A facility provides a thread pool and other resources, with a default thread pool size of 20.
Facilities are used by reactors, with every reactor having a reference to one facility.
A program can have 1 or more facilities, and does not exit normally until 
all the facilities are closed.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/reactors/IsolationReactor.html">IsolationReactor</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            IsolationReactor isolationReactor = new IsolationReactor(facility);
</pre>
<p>
A
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/reactors/Reactor.html">Reactor</a>
processes messages and exchanges messages with other reactors.
Thread safety is achieved by processing only one message at a time.
</p>
<p>
An isolation reactor is a type of reactor which further isolates requests, 
starting a new request only after a result was returned for the previous request.
Isolation reactors are intended for use only when a thread may be blocked due to, for example, blocking I/O or
extensive computations.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/blades/misc/Printer.html">Printer</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            Printer printer = new Printer(isolationReactor);
</pre>
<p>
A printer is an 
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/blades/IsolationBlade.html">IsolationBlade</a>,
which is to say an application object that uses an isolation reactor. It prints to a PrintStream, System.out being the default.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/messages/SyncRequest.html">SyncRequest&lt;RESPONSE_TYPE&gt;</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            SyncRequest<Void> printRequest = printer.printlnSReq("Hello World!");
</pre>
<p>
Blades, like printer, expose requests which can be used to invoke various operations, 
SyncRequest being a type of request whose implementation uses a return statement to return their result.
In this case, printRequest is a request to print "Hello World!".
</p>
<h3>
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/messages/RequestBase.html#call()">call</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            printRequest.call();
</pre>
<p>
Here we print "Hello World!".
But it is printed from the printer's own thread, not from the main thread.
</p>
<p>
The call method of a request provides one way of invoking a request.
The printRequest.call method sends the request to the blade's thread and block the main thread until a result is received.
The call method is the only method in JActor which blocks a thread.
(The call method can not be used by a blade, as it must be invoked from a non-facility thread.)
