<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
We will begin our exploration of JActor2 with a program that prints "Hello World!".
In the process, we will encounter a number of classes which play a major role when using JActor.
</p>
<pre>
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.blades.misc.Printer;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.facilities.Facility;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.messages.SyncRequest;
import org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.reactors.Reactor;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(final String[] _args) throws Exception {
        Facility facility = new Facility();
        try {
            Printer printer = new Printer(facility);
            SyncRequest<Void> printRequest = printer.printlnSReq("Hello World!");
            printRequest.call();
        } finally {
            facility.close();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<h3>
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/facilities/Facility.html">Facility</a>
</h3>
<pre>
        Facility facility = new Facility();
        try {
            ...
        } finally {
            facility.close();
        }
</pre>
<p>
A facility provides a thread pool and other resources, with a default thread pool size of 20.
Facilities are used by reactors, with every reactor having a reference to one facility.
A program can have 1 or more facilities, and does not exit normally until 
all the facilities are closed.
</p>
<h3>
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/blades/misc/Printer.html">Printer</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            Printer printer = new Printer(facility);
</pre>
<p>
A printer is a 
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/blades/IsolationBlade.html">IsolationBlade</a>,
which is to say an application object, which prints to a PrintStream, System.out being the default.
When a printer object is created, an
<a href ="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/reactors/IsolationReactor.html">IsolationReactor</a>
is also created. The isolation reactor uses the provided facility and the printer uses the newly created isolation reactor in turn.
(Isolation reactors are reactors intended for use by blades which perform extensive computation or which block the thread for I/O or other reasons.)
</p>
<h3>
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/messages/SyncRequest.html">SyncRequest&lt;RESPONSE_TYPE&gt;</a>
</h3>
<pre>
            SyncRequest<Void> printRequest = printer.printlnSReq("Hello World!");
</pre>
<p>
Blades, like printer, expose requests which can be used to invoke various operations, 
SyncRequest being a type of request whose implementation uses a return statement to return their result.
In this case, printRequest is a request to print "Hello World!".
</p>
<h3>
<a href="http://laforge49.github.io/JActor2/api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/messages/RequestBase.html#call()">call</a>
</h3>
<p>
Here we print "Hello World!".
But it is printed from the printer's own thread, not from the main thread.
</p>
<p>
The call method of a request provides one way of invoking a request.
The call method send the request to the blade and block the thread until a result is received.
This method is the only method in JActor which blocks a thread.
(The call method can not be used by a blade, as it must be invoked from a non-facility thread.)
