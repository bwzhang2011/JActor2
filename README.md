PActor (POJO Actors)
======

The PActor project will explore the implementation of Java actors implemented without requiring a base class.
Implementation will stress both ease of use and simplicity of implementation.

PActor is a reimplementation of JActor, but without several features.
- There will be only one type of mailbox (asynchronous).
- All message passing will be via the mailbox.
